                    <h2>The Fight For Women's Rights</h2>
                    <h3>How one woman started the conversation we still have in tech today! Equal pay for women.</h3>
                    <h4><strong>Author:</strong>Janet Abbate<br><strong>Date: </strong>12 September 2001</h4>

                    <blockquote><p>Continued from an article <a href="https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Mary_Lee_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">here</a>, on Oral History.</p></blockquote>

                    <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>One of the things that was really interesting in Manchester, though, was the fight for women’s rights.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Abbate:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Really?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Yes. We discovered—I think there were slightly more women than men (I’m not sure about that), and we discovered that the men were getting paid more.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Abbate:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>This was at Ferranti?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Yes. And we were horrified! Ferranti was a very paternal firm. They were shocked that young graduates did something so unprofessional as to discuss with one another what they earned. “Dearie me!” [both laugh] But their argument was that if they knew that Joe Bloggs had a sick wife and real trouble, then they could quietly give him more—provided nobody talked about their salaries, and they couldn't do that in the open—and that a man would have to support a wife and children, and so needed more money than a woman. Well, this went nowhere with the professional women. I used to hear the inside, because at that time I was sharing a flat with the Assistant Personnel Manager for Women, and so a little communication went through this route. I knew what they were thinking in the Personnel Department; and I was the person who was selected to go and see the management and make the case—and we won that.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Abbate:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>So what was the outcome?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>We got equal pay! All the women got raises, to be equal with the men.</p>

                        <blockquote><p><strong>"We got equal pay!"<br> - Mary the Badass, fighting for the right to party (and work for equal pay)</strong></p></blockquote>
                        
                        <p><strong>Abbate:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>So at that point, did a given job position have a given salary?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>It wasn’t strictly laid out, like that in the Civil Service, but the principle was accepted that the young graduates coming in should have the same [salary], whatever the sex; and with promotion, the same raises. They accepted the principle of equal pay, which they hadn’t before.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Abbate:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>What year would this be, more or less?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Berners-Lee:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>This would be—I joined Ferranti in ‘51; this might have been ‘52? Something like that. So, that was a good thing to do.
                        
                        We also had to fight for women’s rights later on. Ferranti had built the computer to the University's design for the University; Ferranti shared the use of it, but as the computer at the university got used more and more and more, Ferranti got restricted in the hours in which we were allowed to use it. It became evening hours, and then later, the university would only let Ferranti have it between midnight and eight in the morning. And it was decreed by the Personnel Department that women should not be there at night—to the glee, I remember, of one particular member of the male staff, because it meant there was more time on the computer for the men! But of course, [for] the women, it was a disastrous idea.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, the Personnel Manager knew that we were there at night, because I shared the flat with the Assistant Personnel Manager, and I started coming in late, and I wouldn’t get in till ten o’clock in the evening, and then midnight, and then later; and one time I hadn’t even come in by the time she went to work in the morning. And the Personnel Department knew about this, and they thought we ought not to work after about ten o’clock or something. But we managed to overrule that. The Personnel Department then suggested that we needed a chaperone, I think—because the maintenance engineers, of course, were always there, and they were men—and suggested we had a tea lady. We managed to override that one as well! [laughs] So we used to get through the night on black coffee!</p>
