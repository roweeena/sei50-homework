# HOMEWORK CHALLENGE: "memoize" the fib_rec() calls -
# Create a hash whose keys are the n argument values given to the function,
# and the first time an answer for n is calculated, store that answer as
# the value of the n key in the hash;
# When the function runs, CHECK the hash to see if there is a key already
# defined for that value of n - if so, use the value of that key as the
# return value of the function INSTEAD OF THE RECURSION
# (if it's not defined, do the recursive calls)

# i.e. increase the TIME efficiency of this function (run faster, less redundant repetition)
# by decreasing the SPACE efficiency (using more memory to store the hash)

def fib_rec( n, memo )

  if(memo.has_key? n)
    puts n, memo
    return memo[n]
  end
  
  # Define our base case:
  if n < 2
    memo[n] = 1;
    return 1
  end

  memo[n] = fib_rec( n-1, memo ) + fib_rec( n-2, memo )
