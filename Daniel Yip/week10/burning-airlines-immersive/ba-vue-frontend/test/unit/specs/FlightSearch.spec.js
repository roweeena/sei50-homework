/*
karma - "test runner", sets up test environment, loads config, loads plugins and assertion library, finds all the .spc.js files and runs the 'describe' and 'it' blocks in the right way for us and does reporting on results
Alternatives: 
  - Jasmine (requires separate assertion library chai or mocha)
  - Jest (FB, includes assertions)

chai - "assertion library", it gives us the assertion syntax like 'expect(a).to.equal(b)'
Alternatives: mocha

vue-test-utils - adapter for mounting components within a headless/test browser environment, and also for querying elements within the "wrapped" DOM, i.e. 'wrapper.findAll("li")'
- it also lets us "interact with out mounted component by triggering clicks and other events, and wait for the results"

sinon - "mock library", i.e. it lets us easilt create mocks/stubs so we can provide fake versions of functions like $router.push to our component, and neatly make assertions about wheather and how those functions were called - a.k.a "mocking".

    // But in our test environment, we are just mounting the
    // component directly, in isolation. So features provided
    // by the router, like 'this.$router', and therefore
    // 'this.$router.push()', are not defined! This means
    // that the component will throw an error when we try
    // to click on the search button, which triggers that
    // router push.
    // SO, since we need to know as the "final output" of this
    // component whether it actually tries to push the correct
    // search results route onto the router... we need to
    // fake the router and in particular, its push() method,
