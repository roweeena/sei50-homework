    Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday,
        Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of
        Sanders.

        (_"What does 'under the name' mean?" asked Christopher Robin._

        "_It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived
        under it._"

        _"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Christopher Robin._

        _"Now I am," said a growly voice._

        _"Then I will go on," said I._)

        One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle
        of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,
        and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.

        Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between
        his paws and began to think.

        First of all he said to himself: "That buzzing-noise means something.
        You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing,
        without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's
        making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise
        that _I_ know of is because you're a bee."

        Then he thought another long time, and said: "And the only reason for
        being a bee that I know of is making honey."

        And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making honey is
        so as _I_ can eat it." So he began to climb the tree.

        He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a
        little song to himself. It went like this:

            Isn't it funny
            How a bear likes honey?
            Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
            I wonder why he does?

        Then he climbed a little further ... and a little further ... and
        then just a little further. By that time he had thought of another song.

            It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,
            They'd build their nests at the _bottom_ of trees.
            And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),
            We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.

        He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a
        Complaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that
        branch ...

        _Crack!_

        "Oh, help!" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.

        "If only I hadn't----" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next
        branch.

        "You see, what I _meant_ to do," he explained, as he turned
        head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below,
        "what I _meant_ to do----"

        "Of course, it _was_ rather----" he admitted, as he slithered very
        quickly through the next six branches.

        "It all comes, I suppose," he decided, as he said good-bye to the last
        branch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,
        "it all comes of _liking_ honey so much. Oh, help!"

        He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose,
        and began to think again. And the first person he thought of was
        Christopher Robin.

        (_"Was that me?" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring
    to believe it._

    "_That was you._"

    _Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and
    his face got pinker and pinker._)

    So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who lived
    behind a green door in another part of the forest.

    "Good morning, Christopher Robin," he said.

    "Good morning, Winnie-_ther_-Pooh," said you.

    "I wonder if you've got such a thing as a balloon about you?"

    "A balloon?"

    "Yes, I just said to myself coming along: 'I wonder if Christopher Robin
    has such a thing as a balloon about him?' I just said it to myself,
    thinking of balloons, and wondering."

    "What do you want a balloon for?" you said.

    Winnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening, put his
    paw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: "_Honey!_"

    "But you don't get honey with balloons!"

    "_I_ do," said Pooh.

    Well, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at
    the house of your friend Piglet, and you had balloons at the party. You
    had had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's relations had had a big
    blue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a
    party at all; and so you had brought the green one _and_ the blue one
    home with you.

    "Which one would you like?" you asked Pooh.

    He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.

    "It's like this," he said. "When you go after honey with a balloon, the
    great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now, if you have
    a green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and
    not notice you, and, if you have a blue balloon, they might think you
    were only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is:
    Which is most likely?"

    "Wouldn't they notice _you_ underneath the balloon?" you asked.

    "They might or they might not," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "You never can
    tell with bees." He thought for a moment and said: "I shall try to look
    like a small black cloud. That will deceive them."

    "Then you had better have the blue balloon," you said; and so it was
    decided.

    Well, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun
    with you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a
    very muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was
    black all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,
    and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go
    suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed
    there--level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from
    it.

    "Hooray!" you shouted.

    "Isn't that fine?" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you. "What do I look
    like?"

    "You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon," you said.

    "Not," said Pooh anxiously, "--not like a small black cloud in a blue
    sky?"

    "Not very much."

    "Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different. And, as I say, you
    never can tell with bees."

    There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He
    could see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn't quite
    reach the honey.

    After a little while he called down to you.

    "Christopher Robin!" he said in a loud whisper.

    "Hallo!"

    "I think the bees _suspect_ something!"

    "What sort of thing?"

    "I don't know. But something tells me that they're _suspicious_!"

    "Perhaps they think that you're after their honey."

    "It may be that. You never can tell with bees."

    There was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.

    "Christopher Robin!"

    "Yes?"

    "Have you an umbrella in your house?"

    "I think so."

    "I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and
    look up at me every now and then, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.'
    I think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are
    practising on these bees."

    Well, you laughed to yourself, "Silly old Bear!" but you didn't say it
    aloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your
    umbrella.

    "Oh, there you are!" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got
    back to the tree. "I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered
    that the bees are now definitely Suspicious."

    "Shall I put my umbrella up?" you said.

    "Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The important bee to
    deceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down
    there?"

    "No."

    "A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying,
    'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little
    Cloud Song, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!"

    So, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain,
    Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song:

        How sweet to be a Cloud
          Floating in the Blue!
        Every little cloud
        _Always_ sings aloud.

        "How sweet to be a Cloud
          Floating in the Blue!"
        It makes him very proud
        To be a little cloud.
