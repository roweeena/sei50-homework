# # Robot Factory 🤖
# You run a robot factory. As robots are created, they roll off the conveyor belt as empty, mindless husks of machinery -- until you first boot them up.
# The first time you boot them up, a random name is randomly generated, and assigned to itself by the robot.
# Names typically take the format of things like "BX777" or "SD234".
# For instance:
# ```rb
# robot1 = Robot.new
# puts robot1.name
# => "BX777"
# robot2 = Robot.new
# puts robot2.name
# => "SD234"
# puts robot2.name
# => "SD234"
# ```
# Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it gives a new name.
# if I say:
# ```rb
# robot3 = Robot.new
# puts robot3.name
# => "RF629"
# robot3.reset
# puts robot3.name
# => "ZC532"
# ```
# ## Extensions 🧯
# ### Counters 🔢
# It's important that we not overwork our robots. While resetting to factory defaults is great, the wear and tear on the robot mechanisms doesn't go away.
# For every action our robot takes, we should keep track of it.
# ```rb
# robot3 = Robot.new
# puts robot3.name
# puts robot3.name
# robot3.reset
# puts robot3.name
# puts robot3.name
# puts robot3.instruction_count
# => 5
# ```
# ### Robot Time ⌚️
# Number of instructions is important, but so is the total age of the robot.
# ```rb
# robot3 = Robot.new
# puts robot3.timers
# => "21 seconds since last boot, 21 seconds since creation"
# robot3.reset
# puts robot3.timers
# => "8 seconds since last boot, 29 seconds since creation"
# ```
