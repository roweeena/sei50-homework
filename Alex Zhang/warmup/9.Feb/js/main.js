// # Counting Valleys
// An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly some number of steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill `U`, or a downhill, `D` step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
// - A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
// - A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
// Write a function that accepts a string as a sequence of up and down steps during a hike, return the number of valleys walked through.
// ```js
// counting_valleys('UDDDUDUU')
// // => expect to return 1
// countingValleys('UDDDUDUUUDDU')
// // => expect to return 2
// ```
// ### Explanation
// If we represent `_` as sea level, a step up as `/`, and a step down as `\`, the hike can be drawn as:
// ```
// _/\      /\
//    \    /  \ /
//     \/\/
// ```

const countingValleys = function(str){
    let valleyCount = 0 //keep track of valley count
    let seaLevel = 0 // keeps track of where the hiker is
  
    //split the string and loop through to check if it's "U" or "D"
  
    str.split('').forEach(step =>{
      if (step === "U"){
        seaLevel++;
      } else if (step === "D"){
        if (seaLevel === 0){
          valleyCount++;
        }
        seaLevel--;
      }
      console.log(seaLevel);
    })
    return valleyCount
  }
  
  
  console.log(countingValleys('UDDDUDUUUDDU')) //expect to return 2
